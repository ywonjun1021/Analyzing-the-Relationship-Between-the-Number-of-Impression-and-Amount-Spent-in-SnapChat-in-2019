# Analyzing the Relationship Between the Number of Impression and Amount Spent in SnapChat in 2019

Using [Snapchat Election Advertising Data](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/), I got the number of impressions and amount spent for an advertisement for year 2019.

Afterward, I used 'regression' in 'data analysis' to analyze the data in depth.

R squared represents the percent of the data that can be represented by this line. 
Based on the regression output, R squared was 0.742, meaning that 74 percent of the data is shown using this model

Significance F is the probability of none of the variables having an impact for impression.
Since I got 0, it shows that variables are impacting the impression

If the P-value is greater than 0.5, that means the statistic is a bad representation.
Thus, I can interpret that it has a very good correlation.

The positive slope shows that there are more number of impressions with more amount of money.

Even though you will get more number of impressions with more money spent, I think there should be a good balance on how much money they spend. The more money spent, the less profit they will get. However, if they spend a small amount of money, the number of impressions will be low,
In the future, i think they should hire Mathematicians or Statisticians to analyze the correct amount of money they should spend.
