# Analyzing the Relationship Between the Number of Impression and Amount Spent in SnapChat in 2019

Using [Snapchat Election Advertising Data](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/), I got the number of impressions and amount spent for an advertisement for year 2019.

Afterward, I used 'regression' in 'data analysis' to analyze the data in depth.

R squared represents the percent of the data that can be represented by this line. 
Based on the regression output, R squared was 0.742, meaning that 74 percent of the data is shown using this model

Significance F is the probability of none of the variables having an impact for impression.
Since I got 0, it shows that variables are impacting the impression

If the P-value is greater than 0.5, that means the statistic is a bad representation.
Thus, I can interpret that it has a very good correlation.

The positive slope shows that there are more number of impressions with more amount of money.

My question was will more money result in more impression? Also is there a case that there are more impressions with a lower amount of money spent?
The answer was yes, more money spent will bring more impression. Thus, if you would want to support a certain candidate, funding would be a best option to support him or her. 
Also, there were cases that there were more impressions with less amount of money spent. I think that is becuase the ads were more interesting that attracted people to click on it more.
