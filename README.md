# Analyzing the Relationship Between the Number of Impression and Amount Spent in SnapChat in 2019

Using [Snapchat Election Advertising Data](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/), I was able to get number of impressions for an advertisement for year 2019.
The reason why I didn't choose 2020 is because i was worried that i will not get an accurate answer due to the lack of data since it has not been a full year yet.
Relatively, 2019 is the recent year that will have a sufficent data. 

After I got the data, I filtered it so I could only get the 2019 data.
Then, I deleted start date and the end date, and created a new column of 'duration.'
With it, I was able to see the length of the time or duration clearly and easily.

Afterward, I used 'regression' in 'data analysis' to analyze the data in depth.
