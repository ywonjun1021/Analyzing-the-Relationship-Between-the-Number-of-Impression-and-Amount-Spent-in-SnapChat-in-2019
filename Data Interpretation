The data and the graph shows that if Snapchat spends mroe money, there will be a higher number of impressions.
The idea is that Snapchat should spend more moeny so that the number of impresisons will rise.
However, I think there should be a good balance on how much money they spend. The more money spent, the less profit they will get. 
Also, if they spend a small amount of money, the number of impressions will be low, and there is no point of spending money.
In the future, i think they should hire Mathematicians or Statisticians to analyze the correct amount of money they should spend.
