My question was will more money result in more impression? 
Also is there a case that there are more impressions with a lower amount of money spent?

The answer was yes, more money spent will bring more impression. 
Thus, if you would want to support a certain candidate, funding would be a best option to support him or her. 
Also, there were cases that there were more impressions with less amount of money spent. 
I think that is becuase the ads were more interesting that attracted people to click on it more.
Even though people were ads for people to click on, if the ads are not interesting, Snapchat users tend to skip it and not watch the ad.
However, even though a candidate spends a low amount of money to advertise their campaign, 
if the advertisement was very interesting, users would click it more and higher up the number of impression.
